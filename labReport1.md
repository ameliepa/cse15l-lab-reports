**Running cd** <br /> <br />

1. **No arguments** <br />

![Image](cd-no-argument.png) <br />

Working directory at the time of running the command: /home <br />

The command cd is intended to change the directory of the terminal with a given path. Since no path was given as an argument, the path did not change. <br />

The output is an error because cd is meant to change the directory of the terminal, but no change occurred. <br />




2. **Path to directory as an argument** <br />

Working directory at the time of running the command: /home <br /> 

Using lecture1 as an arugument with the cd command resulted in the path of the directory changing. I ran pwd after running the lines of code above, and the working directory was no longer /home but instead /home/lecture1. This is also indicated in the command prompt changing from [user@sahara ~]$ to [user@sahara ~/lecture1]. <br /> 

The output is not an error, the code is running as intended. <br />
