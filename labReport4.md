4. Logging into ieng6 <br />
Screenshot
No keys were used. I have an extension called Remote - SSH on VSCode that allows me to access my ieng6 account with one click.

6. Cloning the fork of the repository from my Github account (using the SSH URL) <br />
Screenshot
**Keys used:** g, i, t, \<space>, c, l, o, n, e, \<space>, \<command> + V, \<enter> <br />
Used the git clone command to clone my repository onto my remote account. <br />

8. Running the tests, demonstrating that they fail <br />

**Keys used:** c, d, \<space>, l, a, b, 7, \<enter>, b, a, s, h, \<space>, t, e, s, t, ., s, h, \<enter> <br />
Used cd command to change directory to lab 7, allowing me to then run the bash tests. <br />

9. Editing the code file to fix the failing test <br />

**Keys used:** v, i, m, \<space>, L, i, s, t, E, x, a, m, p, l, e, s, ., j, a, v, a, \<enter>, scroll down and click on 1, x, i, 2, <esc>, :, w, q, <enter> <br />
Used vim to edit the file from the command line. After enter was first pressed, the terminal was in vim. Pressing x after I clicked on 1 resulted in 1 being removed. Pressing i put me in insert mode where I was able to press 2, and use \<esc> to exit insert mode. The command \:wq allowed me to save my changes (the usage of the w) and quit vim (the usage of the q). <br />
